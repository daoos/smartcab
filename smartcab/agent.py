# # Teach a smartcab to drive
# ## Project 4 for the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree
# In this project, we will use Q-learning to train a smartcab to follow traffic rules and reach it's destination in a timely manor
#  
# 
# ## Setup
# 
# You need Python 2.7 and pygame for this project: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
# For help with installation, it is best to reach out to the pygame community [help page, Google group, reddit].

# 
# Next waypoint location, relative to its current location and heading,
# Intersection state (traffic light and presence of cars), and,
# Current deadline value (time steps remaining),
# And produces some random move/action (None, 'forward', 'left', 'right'). Don’t try to implement the correct strategy! That’s exactly what your agent is supposed to learn.
# 
# Run this agent within the simulation environment with enforce_deadline set to False (see run function in agent.py), and observe how it performs. In this mode, the agent is given unlimited time to reach the destination. The current state, action taken by your agent and reward/penalty earned are shown in the simulator.
# 
# In your report, mention what you see in the agent’s behavior. Does it eventually make it to the target location?

# 
# When we run an agent with a random action policy, we see that it will move about the board with no pattern, and will eventually reach the destination, in most cases. If we allow the use of deadlines, we see that the agent rarely reaches the destination in time, although it may still occur.

# 
# At each time step, process the inputs and update the current state. Run it again (and as often as you need) to observe how the reported state changes through the run.

# ### Identify and update state - Discussion.
# When we sense our environment, we perceive 5 variables, with several possible states These include: left, light, next_waypoint, oncoming, and right. We can see right away that light and next_waypoint contains new information at every poll, while the others usually have no value. 
# 
# It's not readily apparent that the direction of travel information of the other cars (described by left/right/oncoming) is relevant to our agent. A case could be made to remove the direction information, and only retain information about another car being present at the light. This would have the benefit of reducing the number of possible states, increasing the speed of the agent. This may be a valuable approach in resource constrained environments. 
# 
# The downside is that the agent may pick an action that causes a longer trip. Early in the learning phase, it could also pick an action incorrectly. For instance, by proceeding through a light when the opposite car is turning left. In this case, it may have previously seen a positive reward for moving through the light, because the opposite car was not turning. This time through, it will recieve a negative reward, and in the future when a car is at the oncoming light, it will always wait till the intersection is clear.
# 
# In the interest of correctness, we will choose to use the state as returned from the sensor, with the addition of the next_waypoint.
# 
# While I have tracked the deadline, it is not apparent that it will provide useful information to the agent. It is useful to see note that the agent does not see any usefull increase in the deadline value yet. We may expect this to adapt as we implement learning.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# ## Implement Q-Learning
# 
# Implement the Q-Learning algorithm by initializing and updating a table/mapping of Q-values at each time step. Now, instead of randomly selecting an action, pick the best action available from the current state based on Q-values, and return that.
# 
# Each action generates a corresponding numeric reward or penalty (which may be zero). Your agent should take this into account when updating Q-values. Run it again, and observe the behavior.
# 
# What changes do you notice in the agent’s behavior?

# ### Implement Q-Learning - Discussion
# With a basic Qlearning algorithm, we note that the agent quickly learns a set of rules that allow the agent to move toward the objective. Generarlly speaking the agent, is moving to the destination, but does not always make optimal choices.  We see the agent begin to obey some traffic rules and make moves toward it's destination. We can see that now the reward in each run is generally positive.
# 
# We don't see a large continued increase in the agent speed toward the destination after the initial runs. We still see strange behavior such as repeated right turns back to the original destination, or staying in a no action state for extended periods, without much change in pattern through the run. With Epsilon set to 0, we don't see the agent select new behaviors, and with Gamma at 0 we don't consider our future state.
# 

# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# ## Enhance the driving agent
# 
# Apply the reinforcement learning techniques you have learnt, and tweak the parameters (e.g. learning rate, discount factor, action selection method, etc.), to improve the performance of your agent. Your goal is to get it to a point so that within 100 trials, the agent is able to learn a feasible policy - i.e. reach the destination within the allotted time, with net reward remaining positive.
# 
# Report what changes you made to your basic implementation of Q-Learning to achieve the final version of the agent. How well does it perform?
# 
# Does your agent get close to finding an optimal policy, i.e. reach the destination in the minimum possible time, and not incur any penalties?

# ## Enhance the driving agent - Discussion
# We immediatly see the agent begin learning when we begin using epsilon to explore new states. The addition of gamma provides many of the same benefits, and we see that the agent learns to reach the destination as quickly as the first or second run. Following this, the agent will quickly begin to reach it's destination well before the deadline, with a positive score, the majority of times. Even at the end of the run, we do still seem odd behaviors, as the agent tries new methods according to epsilon, or encounters new states.
# 
# In addition to tuning the final epsilon and gamma, I have a added the ability for each to adjust the amount they affect the outcome over time. Initially we want to prefer a random action, as our table is initialized with zero's, and we want to explore the available states, and record their affects. The opposite is true for gamma. In it's case, we would like to ignore any initial knowledge initially, and over time grow to trust what we know. My implementation allows us to control the rate of change over time of each. I have selected starting/ending values and rates based on experimentation, but we would likely be able to optimize these numbers further by implementing a gridsearch type algorithm to test the values over multiple runs, etc.
# We could also implement methods to adjust these rates based on things other than time, for example based on the difference between the current and new values.
